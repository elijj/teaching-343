#What is Phaser?

"Phaser is an HTML5 game framework which aims to help developers make powerful, cross-browser HTML5 games really quickly and, unlike some others, has solely been built to work with the mobile browsers. The only browser requirement is the support of the canvas tag. It also borrows a lot from Flixel." -http://phaser.io/

#Part I : init , preload, create

http://plnkr.co/edit/SAO9uhn37Cr25boXQf7K

#init

inti is for 

#preload

preload is for preloading assets that will be used for the game 

#try adding your own sprite

{link to sprite creator}

#create

create is for setting variables like: stage, sky, platfroms, player, physics, camera, cursors

stage: {jist of what it is for}

sky: {jist of what it is for}

platfroms: {jist of what it is for}

player: {jist of what it is for}

physics: {jist of what it is for}

camera: {jist of what it is for}

cursors: {jist of what it is for}

Note where the game canvas will be, like for this one it's set in the body, but maybe other developers might not want it positioned like we have it here.


Try changing stage, sky, or camera to see it's different results.


So now you'll have now created all the parts to start stepping through your game.

#Part II : (so continue like this format) 

through at least one more part and plnkr link with things that are crucial to adding so that the next plnkr is not just a completed version.

#Conclusion : 
This example of the use of phaser does not work well on mobile devices. Possible solutions to implementing a touch screen game by setting the cursors to be based off touch screen gestures which could be achieved with a solution like JQueryMobile - http://api.jquerymobile.com/ or ??????????
